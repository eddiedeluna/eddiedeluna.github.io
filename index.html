	    <h1>Kevin Durant</h1>
		<p>30 ppg, 8 assist, 3 robounds.</P>
	
		<h1>Lebron James</h1>

	    <h3>Who's better?</h3>
	    <p> Kevin Durant is clearly better than Lebron     James. Considering that he is a way better scoring machine than James and he is also much taller. But one can argue than LBJ's defense is better than Durants.</p>
